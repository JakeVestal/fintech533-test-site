## FINAL HW!!!!!
Continue working with TAs and instructor on your site. By next week,


1) A blotter
2) A ledger
add an
interactive plot! Here's a demo using OJS:

```{ojs}
data = FileAttachment("./palmer-penguins.csv").csv({ typed: true })
```

```{ojs}
viewof bill_length_min = Inputs.range(
  [32, 50],
  {value: 35, step: 1, label: "Bill length (min):"}
)
viewof islands = Inputs.checkbox(
  ["Torgersen", "Biscoe", "Dream"],
  { value: ["Torgersen", "Biscoe"],
    label: "Islands:"
  }
)
```
```{ojs}
filtered = data.filter(function(penguin) {
  return bill_length_min < penguin.bill_length_mm &&
         islands.includes(penguin.island);
})
```
```{ojs}
Plot.rectY(filtered,
  Plot.binX(
    {y: "count"},
    {x: "body_mass_g", fill: "species", thresholds: 20}
  ))
  .plot({
    facet: {
      data: filtered,
      x: "sex",
      y: "species",
      marginRight: 80
    },
    marks: [
      Plot.frame(),
    ]
  }
)
```


## Homework 2.2!

your homework is to please do the following:

0) **Make sure the instructor has added the URL you want to use to the list
above!!!!** This is what will be graded

1) write a brief outline of your trading strategy & plan.
    - Discuss with Instructor & TAs over teams!!!!
    - add it to your site
    - main thing is: walk us through a single trade. Entry signal / exit
    signal, plus other rules like stoploss.
    - you'll may communicate with course instructor and TAs to ensure you
    meet requirements.

2) Obtain some (or all?) of the data you'll need -- features, prices, etc
    - discuss this too!

3) Add your plan as a nicely formatted text to your site, and push
4) Add some data -- ANY data at all -- as a table to your site to
practice/demonstrate how to add tables
5) Add an image. Any image will do. Use the example on the cheatsheet below.

## Helpful info
- cheatsheet of 'how to markdown' in quarto:
<https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html>
- You don't have to add a table explicitly, of course. There are plenty of
packages for doing things like that, as in the example below


```{python}
#| label: tbl-planets
#| tbl-cap: Astronomical object

from IPython.display import Markdown
from tabulate import tabulate
table = [["Sun","696,000",1.989e30],
         ["Earth","6,371",5.972e24],
         ["Moon","1,737",7.34e22],
         ["Mars","3,390",6.39e23]]
Markdown(tabulate(
  table,
  headers=["Astronomical object","R (km)", "mass (kg)"]
))
```
