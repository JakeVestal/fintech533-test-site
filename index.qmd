Homework 2.2!

your homework is to please do the following:

0) **Make sure the instructor has added the URL you want to use to the list
above!!!!** This is what will be graded

1) write a brief outline of your trading strategy & plan.
    - Discuss with Instructor & TAs over teams!!!!
    - add it to your site
    - main thing is: walk us through a single trade. Entry signal / exit
    signal, plus other rules like stoploss.
    - you'll may communicate with course instructor and TAs to ensure you
    meet requirements.

2) Obtain some (or all?) of the data you'll need -- features, prices, etc
    - discuss this too!

3) Add your plan as a nicely formatted text to your site, and push
4) Add some data -- ANY data at all -- as a table to your site to
practice/demonstrate how to add tables

## Helpful info
- cheatsheet of 'how to markdown' in quarto: <https://quarto
.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html>
- You don't have to add a table explicitly, of course. There are plenty of
packages for doing things like that, as in the example below


```{python}
#| label: tbl-planets
#| tbl-cap: Astronomical object

from IPython.display import Markdown
from tabulate import tabulate
table = [["Sun","696,000",1.989e30],
         ["Earth","6,371",5.972e24],
         ["Moon","1,737",7.34e22],
         ["Mars","3,390",6.39e23]]
Markdown(tabulate(
  table,
  headers=["Astronomical object","R (km)", "mass (kg)"]
))
```
